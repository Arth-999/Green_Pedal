# Green_Pedal
A new Flutter project built from scratch.</br>

A bicycle rental application built using-</br>

1) Cloud Firestore as database,</br>
2) Firebase_auth for authentication,</br>
3) Google map api for showing Google-map,</br>
4) Barcode_scan2 for QR code scanner.</br>

# Application overview

with different bicycle options along with other details . The user can rent cycle after scanning a Qr-code . The drawer widget shows
